# Remember Me

### **Memorial Blog for a Bereaved Child**

### Purpose

This project is a tribute and memory-preservation website created for a child who has lost a parent at a young age. Its purpose is to serve as a digital memory book where family members, friends, and loved ones can share stories, photos, and memories about the parent who has passed away. By capturing and preserving these heartfelt memories, the project aims to provide the child with a lifelong keepsake, offering comfort, connection, and a sense of their parent’s life and legacy as they grow older.

### Project Audience

- **Primary Audience**: The primary audience of this project is the child for whom the site is dedicated. As the child grows, they can revisit the website to read stories, view photos, and gain a better understanding of their parent’s personality, values, and impact on others.
  
- **Contributors**: Family members, friends, and loved ones who wish to share memories, stories, or meaningful photos/videos of the parent.

- **Site Admin**: An individual (or small team) who will manage the website, moderate content, and ensure posts are appropriate and respectful. The admin will also handle user roles and control access to ensure the security and reliability of the platform.

### Key Features

1. **Memory Sharing**: A central blog-like section where registered users can post stories, memories, photos, and videos about the child’s parent. Posts can include heartfelt stories, memorable moments, or any thoughts that capture the parent’s essence.
   
2. **Comments**: Each memory entry allows users to leave comments, creating a space for additional reflections, shared anecdotes, or supportive messages.

3. **Role-Based Access**: 
   - **Public Users** can read memories and view content but cannot contribute without creating an account.
   - **Registered Users** (e.g., family, close friends) can post new memories, upload media, and comment on existing posts.
   - **Admin** has the authority to approve, edit, or delete posts and comments to ensure content is appropriate.

4. **Responsive and Accessible Design**: Designed to be child-friendly with a calm, warm aesthetic. The layout is responsive, adjusting seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). Accessibility is a key focus, ensuring the site is navigable for all users, including those with disabilities.

5. **Security and Privacy**: The site includes strong privacy measures to ensure that sensitive information and personal memories are protected. Data security measures include secure authentication, role-based access control, and environment-variable-based security for sensitive data.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive and engaging user interface.
- **Backend**: Python with Django, providing the structure for user authentication, CRUD functionality, and content moderation.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or MySQL), for secure data storage and relationship management between users, posts, and comments.

### Goals and Impact

The project is intended to provide the bereaved child with a tangible, emotional connection to their parent as they grow up. By preserving these stories, the site becomes more than just a collection of memories—it serves as a source of comfort, legacy, and identity. This memory-keeping platform is designed to honor the parent’s life and offer the child an understanding of who their parent was, through the lens of those who knew them best.

### Deployment

The project will be deployed on a cloud hosting platform like Heroku, making it accessible to family and friends online. Deployment will include environment configurations, security settings, and testing to ensure reliability and user-friendliness.
